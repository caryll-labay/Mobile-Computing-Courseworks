# Kotlin Problem 1

For a given string ``s`` find the character ``c`` (or ``C``) with longest consecutive repetition and return:
```
Pair(c, l)
```

where ``l`` (or ``L``) is the length of the repetition. If there are two or more characters with the same ``l`` return the first in order of appearance.

For empty string return:

```
Pair(null, 0)
```
