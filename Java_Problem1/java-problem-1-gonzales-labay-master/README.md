# Java Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution (``src/main/java/com.example.project/Solution.java``) so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. 
Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

### Test Cases

See ``src/test/java/com.example/project/TestSolution.java``
